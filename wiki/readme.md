# Project Shanti 
A next generation device to help you get things done without getting distracte

## Big Ambition

The way we interact with computers will change. The way computers learn from us will change.

### Assumptions and Hypotheses
We believe that action based workflows can be highly optimized and computers can be trained more efficiently to learn human workflows if we introduce a new interaction mechanism that utilizes spatial associations, handwritings and drawings to demonstrate concept which will lead to higher productivity and help users get things done.

Computers have trouble understanding and making associations without large datasets- but we believe a stronger spatially oriented system allows users to design algorthims visually and organize thoughts to create actionable lists

### Trainable Actions

- Template multiplication
- Repeat actions 
- [Examples](https://www.google.com/amp/s/lifehacker.com/automate-just-about-anything-on-your-windows-pc-no-cod-5669762/amp)

##### Example Workflows

Assume a user is sending a template email. If he is sending a template, he can write it once, write multiply and quickly iterate through repeats

If a user crops an image twice and keeps going, the system can suggest applying to everything 

### Business Model and Revenue
- the hardware allows for a unique experience but it can also be acheived cheaper with a simple LCD making it accessible 
- an automation platform where people may publish interaction models
- compatibility with existing tablets and devices also allows for easy additions

### Risk and Validations Needed
- Existing workflows with current tablet and computer devices and time taken
- determine repeating Action based workflows
- Time taken with shanti vs others
- Average eye strain with shanti
- Schools using iPad's for education

## Things we will Change Forever
- Create a more natural way to interact
- Higher end user productivity
- The way computers learn from human interactions
- A better way to design algorithms and manipulate data
- A stronger voice and visual operating system
- Higher user productivity
- Notifaction Strategy

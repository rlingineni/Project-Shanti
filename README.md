# Project-Shanti

This is Project Shanti (śāntiḥ) - which means peace in Sanksrit. The origin of this project began as a quest to find and explore how we could design a better everyday device that:

1. Is not Absorbing
  - Modern devices have unintended consequences on the human mind and our ability to focus and be attentive. We find ourselves looking at our phone out of habit and not always necessity. We hope that tries not to absorb and doesn't allow users to feel out of sync with their surroundings.

2. Is Invisible
  - Modern computers are incredbily complex and they will only get faster and better. However, this does not mean that the software a user interacts necessarily gets more reliable or stable. As a user of a modern device - we should not be presented with a sluggish system or an intrusive experience that focuses my work from the action to be done to keeping up with the system.
  
3. Helps get Work Done
  - Although we prefer a device that is less distracting and simpler - we still need devices that help us accomplish our daily tasks more efficiently. We don't want to sacrifice the modern conveninces we have accrued. The ideal device would allow us to focus but still let us get things done that we previosly were accustomed too.
  
4. Easy on the Eyes
  - Research has repeatedly shown a side effect from increases use of our portable devices and LCDs uptick results in increased astigmatism, dry eyes and headaches. The blue light prevents us from getting a good night's rest, albeit the wonders it can display.

## Our Success Metrics

#### Qualitative
We consider a 5 point NSAT on our device as a mark of consumer satisfaction for each of the requirement areas and a user's percieved impression after utilizing our final product.

#### Quantative
A quanifiable metric for our final device benchmark is to consider the time from "thought" to action. This can be translated to the number of clicks to perform actions, the response time of applications and physical attributes such as blue light emissions and battery life.

## Our Device
A lot of research has gone into designing Shanti. It originally began as a replacement to a traditional mobile device utilizing an E-Ink display. Unfortunately, the display technology, although easy on the eyes, is not easily responsive. 

The framework of the device utilizes an *always on* transparent cholesteric liquid crystal display (ChLCD) as commonly utilized in modern e-writers. The power and lifespan of which can last up to years. However, tradeoffs include the lack of clear way to record what has been written on the screen.

Beneath the ChLCD is a high definition LCD - that augments the transparent display. We then begin to animate and join the two processes utlizing a touch sensor that interjoins the two screen interfaces to build a new working display that meets our requirements as mentioned above. 

This is better vieweed as a demo.
